# Lab report \#1

Follow the instructions posted at
<https://ds202-at-isu.github.io/labs.html> for the lab assignment. The
work is meant to be finished during the lab time, but you have time
until Monday evening to polish things.

Include your answers in this document (Rmd file). Make sure that it
knits properly (into the md file). Upload both the Rmd and the md file
to your repository.

All submissions to the github repo will be automatically uploaded for
grading once the due date is passed. Submit a link to your repository on
Canvas (only one submission per team) to signal to the instructors that
you are done with your submission.

Ethan Mangelsdorf - The lab experience went well, I learned on how use
github in conjunction with rstudio and how to show my changes and edits
that I made using Rstudio on github.

Drew Kinneer- Lab went very smoothly. Git had a few issues with RStudio
but after fixing my authentication it worked great.
